# Chatting-application

Java Two-Person Chat Application
This is a simple two-person chat application built in Java. It allows two users to send and receive text messages in real-time over a network. The application is designed to be straightforward, demonstrating basic networking concepts using sockets.

# How It Works
The application operates on a client-server model. One user acts as the server, and the other user acts as the client.
The server application listens for incoming connections from the client.
The client application connects to the server.
Once the connection is established, both users can type messages and send them to the other.
Messages are transmitted as data streams over the network, ensuring a continuous flow of conversation.

# Features
Real-time Messaging: Messages appear instantly in the other user's chat window.
Simple GUI: A user-friendly interface with a message input box and a conversation display area.
Networking: Implements basic Java socket programming for communication.
Separate Client/Server Logic: The code is structured with distinct client and server components for clear functionality.

# Technologies Used

Swing/AWT: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket: For network communication.
